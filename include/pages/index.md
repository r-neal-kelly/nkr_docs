# Overview
@ref nkr is a static 64 and 32 bit C++20 library providing powerfully generic types, versatile traits and interfaces, and a formal meta-programming language called nkr::tr to dynamically define C++20 concepts in-place with arbitrary constraints and arbitrary precision. @ref nkr comes with a robust and comprehensive set of test suites to ensure correctness and performance, as well as an all-encompassing set of documentation to guarantee understanding and usability. Currently available for Windows with future plans for a port to Linux.

# Status

We are in the alpha phase of the library and it has not seen its first release yet. Currently we are prototyping and designing the overarching system of types, traits, and interfaces, and importantly, we are also designing the documentation itself.
